class AssessmentReferralModel(object):
    '''
    Adapted from a model that implements the Mental Wellbeing and Access 'Assessment Referral'
    model in Pitt, Monks and Allen (2015). https://bit.ly/3j8OH6y

    In original model, patients arrive at random and in proportion to the regional team.
    Patients may be seen by any team identified by a pooling matrix.
    This includes limiting a patient to only be seen by their local team.

    In this version of the model, patients arrive roughly in line with a desired
    annual number of arrivals distribution.
    Patients may be discharged before assessment if deemed inappropriate for the service.
    While patients initially have a different 'home clinic' (due to modifying the existing model),
    this is effectively ignored and, if deemed appropriate, they are booked in with any clinician
    to begin with based on available capacity.

    Patients are classified as high or low priority on referral.
    High priority patients go to the front of a queue of patients who have not yet been booked in
    for their assessment appointment.

    When booking patient in, the total caseload of the clinicians is taken into account. The aim of this
    check is to avoid taking on too many clients relative to the number of clinical slots they have
    available per week. The max caseload defaults to the number of clinical slots (though bear in mind
    that a patient being seen every other week will take up 0.5 slots, not 1).
    1 weekly appointment = 1 caseload slot
    2 weekly appointments = 2 caseload slots (not implemented here)
    1 appointment every other week = 0.5 caseload slots
    and so on.
    The caseload can be multiplied by a factor to allow more clients to exist on caseload at any one time.

    After referral, a sampling distribution is consulted to determine whether the client is discharged at this point
    or continues on to have some number of regular repeat appointments.

    If they are going to continue, it will also be determined whether they are having high- or low-intensity therapy.
    High-priority patients are most likely to go on to high-intensity therapy (every week - 1 caseload slot) but have
    a chance of requiring low intensity.
    Low-priority patients are most likely to go on to low-intensity therapy (every other week - 0.5 caseload slots) but have
    a chance of requiring high intensity.

    A sampling distribution is then used to determine the number of follow-up appointments each patient will have, with
    different distributions used for the different intensities (and lower-intensity patients requiring fewer
    sessions on average).

    Patients will then exit the simulation after this number of appointments has elapsed.

    Various metrics are available as outputs, along with full event logs that can support animations.
