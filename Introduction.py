This streamlit app demonstrates the use of [**vidigi**](https://github.com/Bergam0t/vidigi), a visual interactive simulation (VIS) package for showing the position of queues and resource utilisation in a manner understandable to stakeholders.

It is also valuable for developers, as the functioning of the simulation can be more easily monitored.

It is designed for integration with simpy - however, in theory, it could be integrated with different simulation packages in Python or other languages, and you can find an example of its use with the *ciw** simulation package in the *vidigi* documentation.

Please use the tabs on the left hand side to view different examples of how this package can be used.
